# Food Playground 

## Elevator Pitch

A playground for young children to interact with the different food groups. Each food group shows interesting facts designed for kids. They can also take a quiz afterwards if they wish.

## How to use
The user will first be presented with some different images "floating" in space. When each image is hovered over, they display a CSS animation to make it further appear that they are floating. The images also use JavaScript, so that they can be dragged around on the screen. When the user double clicks a food item, it will redirect them to a page that will tell them fun facts about that food group. The user can also navigate between the different food groups using the nav bar. Finally, the user can take a quiz. When the user submits the quiz, it will redirect to a page that shows their grade, and gives them a different gif depending on their score.
